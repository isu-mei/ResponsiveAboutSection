                    <h3>Junior Web Developer</h3>
                    <p>With previous experience as an Executive Secretary and Administrative Assistant, I have always had an interest in coding.
                       Having recently completed the Junior Web Developer Bootcamp at Generation Australia in collaboration with Academy Xi, my
                       curiosity about coding has now turned out to be my passion. As a lifelong learner, I will continue to seek to develop and 
                       grow my front-end tech skills in an innovative environment.</p>
